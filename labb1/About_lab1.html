                <h1> About</h1>
                <h6> Hello, I'm Isac, a passionate fitness enthusiast currently pursuing my fifth year of engineering studies in the beautiful city of Umeå. Alongside my academic endeavors, I'm working towards a master's degree in risk management, specialized in the banking and insurance sector. <br>
                    <br>
                    My journey in engineering has not only deepened my understanding of complex systems but has also fueled my curiosity for finding solutions to real-world challenges. I thrive on the dynamic nature of risk management, where each obstacle becomes an opportunity for growth and learning.
                    <br> <br>
                    Beyond the academic realm, you'll often find me immersed in the world of fitness. Whether it's lifting weights, exploring new workout routines, or advocating for a healthy lifestyle, I believe in the transformative power of physical well-being. The discipline and dedication required in fitness mirror the principles I apply in both my academic and personal pursuits.
                    <br> <br>
                    As I navigate the intersection of technology, risk, and well-being, I am driven by a commitment to contribute meaningfully to both the engineering field and the broader community. Join me on this journey of exploration, growth, and the pursuit of a balanced and fulfilling life.
